Something clicked in me that day: a feeling, a love for wildlife, that wasn't yet ready to fully bloom. It did during my university years, along with the certainty that it would never leave me again. Today I've made my passion my job. I love spending time outdoors, in the woods, in the company of my dogs or even just in silence with my camera, waiting for a kingfisher to perch on the branch in front of me."
